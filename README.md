# Advent of Go

Solutions to puzzles from the [Advent of Code][adventofcode].

I am resolving a handful the AoC 2017 problems to help myself learn [Go][go]. More complete solution sets exist in my [Aoc 2016][aoc-rust] and [AoC 2017][aoc-kotlin] repositories.

All solutions in this repository were compiled with go 1.12.

## Running a Solution

Solutions can be run using the standard `go` utility with the following format.

```bash
$ go run year day [input-file]
```

If an input file is not specified, it will default to `resources/{year}/day{day}.txt`. To read input from sdin, using the file name `--`.
